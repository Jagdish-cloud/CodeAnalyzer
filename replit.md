## Overview
This is a full-stack web application built with Express.js and React, designed for managing educational institutions and their branches. The application provides a comprehensive form system for adding institutions with detailed branch information, contact persons, and administrative settings.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and bundling
- **UI Framework**: Shadcn/ui components built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **State Management**: React hooks for local state, TanStack Query for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **Form Management**: React Hook Form with Zod validation

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM configured for PostgreSQL
- **File Uploads**: Multer middleware for handling file uploads
- **Session Management**: Connect-pg-simple for PostgreSQL session storage

### Database Architecture
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured but can be provisioned later)
- **ORM**: Drizzle ORM with type-safe schema definitions
- **Schema**: Two main tables - users and institutions
- **Migrations**: Managed through Drizzle Kit

## Key Components

### 1. Institution Management System
- **Purpose**: Core functionality for managing educational institutions

3. File uploads processed through Multer middleware
4. Data submitted to `/api/institutions` endpoint
5. Server validates and stores in PostgreSQL
6. Response returned with created institution data

### 2. Data Storage Strategy
- **Structured Data**: Primary institution fields in PostgreSQL columns
- **Complex Data**: Branch and contact information stored as JSON
- **Files**: Uploaded images stored in local filesystem
- **Sessions**: PostgreSQL-backed session storage for user management
